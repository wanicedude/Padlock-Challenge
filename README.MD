PADLOCK CHALLENGE: Series 1 - 5

For each of these challenges you will need to write a computer program to work out the padlock code (3-digit number). Your program will need to output the solution of the given hint. You will then be able to input this combination onto the padlock to see if it unlocks it!

For Series 1:
 where  code = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + â€¦ + 38 + 39 + 40

For Series 2:
 where code = Total number of 3-digit combinations where digit1 < digit2 < digit3 
 e.g. 123 and 358 count as valid combinations whereas 321 or 011 are invalid combinations.

For Series 3:
 where code = Total number of 3-digit combinations where digit1, digit2 and digit3 are all even numbers
 e.g. 024 and 886 count as valid combinations whereas 124 or 456 are invalid combinations.

For Series 4:
 where code = Total number of 3-digit combinations where the sum of all three digits (digit1 + digit2 + digit3) is an odd number
 e.g. 034 and 555 count as valid combinations whereas 123 or 468 are invalid combinations.


For Series 5:
 where code = Total number of 3-digit combinations where at least two digits are equal.
e.g. 030 and 558 count as valid combinations whereas 123 or 468 are invalid combinations.
